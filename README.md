# DuckieTown-TomCatGroup
Smartlab2021-DeepLearningInPractice

The TomCat Group was responsible for the DuckieTown project, where the first milestone was to prepare our systems to run the virtual environment and prepare the neural networks to be taught in it.

We started teaching on separate machines using both CPU and GPU. The results speak for themselves, as we ran out of resources very quickly.

In this project, the teaching, validating and testing databases are all visual inputs provided by the virtual environment.
